We have about 100 quadrillions possible starting hands for each player (1000 trillion = 1 quadrillion)
"100 000 000 000 000 000" or 10^17. We probably can't brute force an algorithm.

Therefore we need a much more sophisticated approach to this problem!

We have 10 518 000 possible combinations for a single player. He doesn't know the hands of his opponents anyway.
Therefore we can brute force some algorithm there (Monte Carlo). However the context of the game is changed whenever
another player plays a card.

We have much less "meaningful" combinations (When you have 4J, you don't really care if the fifth card is 8❖ or 8♥)

Before announcing (when we have 5 cards) we have 201 376 combinations. Not to mention that when we have J♥, 9♥, 10♥,
A♤, 10♤ and J♤, 9♤, 10♤, A♥, 10♥ its basically the pattern and logic.
